    //OOP - Inheritence, Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism
    //In JS we dont have classes. Instead we use functions.
    //There are 2 ways to create a custom object
    //1. Constructor function
    //2. Literal notation

    //Creating an object using constructor fucntion
    function Employee(firstName, lastName)
    {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.getFullName = function(){
            return this.firstName+" "+this.lastName;
        };
    }

    var employee1 = new Employee("Gowresh", "Nagesh");
    console.log(employee1.firstName);
    console.log(employee1.lastName);
    console.log(employee1.getFullName());

    //Creating an object using Literal notation
    //Objects created using literals are singletons.
    //This means when a change is made to the object, it affects that object across the entire script.
    var employee = {
        firstName : "Sukanya",
        lastName : "Shetty",
        getFullName : function(){
            return this.firstName+" "+this.lastName;

    console.log(employee.firstName);
    console.log(employee.lastName);
