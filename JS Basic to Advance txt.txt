Examples of JavaScript Programmes for Beginners

I would also like to list some programmes which Beginners should implement.

1. Create a program where user inputs 2 int values in 2 input boxes and you display the greatest of them on the alert box, when a button is clicked.

2. Create a program where user enters a number in a text box and you should display its table (upto 10) on a div. The table should be created on the button click event. Also prevent user to enter string on the text box (give appropriate error on alert box when input is string).
